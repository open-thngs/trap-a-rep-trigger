# Rep Trap 

The Rep Trap idea is a hardware system designed to overcome the limitations and challenges of conventional trapping methods. Inspired by PIR sensors commonly used in wildlife cameras, the hardware system features a gate-like sensor arrangement, specifically designed for animals to pass through. Positioned with its sensor element facing downwards, the system incorporates a distance measurement unit within the sensor. This unit continuously measures the height below the sensor, detecting any changes in height.
